# Blender objects alignment addon

A while ago a friend of mine asked me to create a simple addon for objects alignment. I have experience of Python and some tiny one of Blender, thus I agreed and then created what you see here.

I'm not obsessed with this project, so don't wait frequent updates. Any adequate contributions are welcome.
